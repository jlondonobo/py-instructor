# Py-Instructor

Ideas for creating an awesome **Python** presentation based on [Instructor](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/).

To become a **Master Instructor** I must become a black belt in the arts of:
- Instructor
- Pydantic
- OpenAI's client

Optionally, I can also use **Rye** for package management!
